The morning of {month} {day}, little { reader's name} was walking to {place}. 

On the way to {place}, {name} saw {famous person} lying on the street. What happened to poor {famous person}? It seems that they may have {action verb, past tense} in the middle of the street. Oh dear!

{reader} helps them by {action verb - ing} and calling {an emergency service}, before continuing on their way to {place}.

"What should I eat for breakfast," says {reader}, who forgot to eat breakfast. As they walk into a store, they decide on {food item}. 

Noticing that they are almost late, it would be smart for {reader} to call using their {thing} to hail a ride on a/an {noun} to {place}.

Due to {objects} and {animals} on the road, there was a great big traffic jam.

Sadly, because this mode of transportation was slow and due to the congestion, {reader} was late to participate in {event} and was thus forced to do {noun, punishment} as punishment.
