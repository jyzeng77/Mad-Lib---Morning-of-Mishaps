# Create your own Mad Lib

Mad Libs is a simple word substitution game.  You ask for a number of words without giving the user any context (noun, verb, adjective etc..) and then you place their answers into an existing paragraph and read/display exactly as it as.  Often these result in funny and weird phrases.

Your job is to write a program that will ask the user for a number of inputs (5-10) of different types of words and then insert them into a pre-generated story of your creation.   Get creative and have your family try it out.
